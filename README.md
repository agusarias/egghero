## Running

It's a [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) project, that uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as a dependency manager.

## Contribution

I'm not developing this any further, but you can send a PR if you feel like adding or fixing anything :)

## Licence
I can't remember the license of some of the assets, but it's safe to assume that it's ok to share it.
